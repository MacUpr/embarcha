Setting up Edge Impulse Model
Train your model on Edge Impulse Studio:
Create a new project
Upload your IMU data (accelerometer + gyroscope)
Label data as "mar_agitado" or "mar_calmo"
Design impulse with preprocessing and classification
Train and test your model
Download the C++ library:
Go to your Edge Impulse project
Navigate to "Deployment" â†’ "C++ library"
Download the ZIP file
Extract the contents to get:
edge-impulse-sdk/ folder
model-parameters/ folder
tflite-model/ folder
Place the Edge Impulse files in your project directory as shown in the structure above.
Building the Project
Using the Makefile (Recommended)
bash
# Build the project
make build

# Clean build files
make clean

# Build and deploy to Pico
make deploy

# Monitor serial output
make monitor
Using CMake directly
bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

# Build
make -j4
Environment Setup
Make sure you have the following environment variables set:

bash
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk
export PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/path/to/arm-none-eabi-gcc
Usage
Running the Application
Connect your hardware according to the wiring diagram above
Build and flash the firmware to your Pico
Connect via USB and open a serial monitor (115200 baud)
Move the sensor to simulate different sea conditions
Expected Behavior
The system will:

Initialize the MPU-6500 sensor
Collect 2 seconds of sensor data (100 samples at 50Hz)
Run inference using your Edge Impulse model
Display predictions on the serial monitor
Light up the appropriate LED:
ðŸ”´ Red LED: "mar_agitado" (rough sea)
ðŸŸ¢ Green LED: "mar_calmo" (calm sea)

Configuration
Sampling Parameters
You can adjust the sampling parameters in config.h:

SAMPLE_RATE_HZ: Data collection frequency (default: 50Hz)
WINDOW_SIZE_MS: Inference window size (default: 2000ms)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: Minimum confidence for classification
Hardware Pins
Modify pin assignments in config.h if you need different connections:

I2C pins (SDA/SCL)
LED pins (red/green)
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Build errors: Make sure PICO_SDK_PATH is set correctly
I2C communication errors: Check wiring and pull-up resistors
Model size too large: Reduce model complexity in Edge Impulse
Inference errors: Verify model files are in correct directories
Debug Options
Enable debug output in config.h:

c
#define DEBUG_SENSOR_DATA 1    // Print raw sensor values
#define DEBUG_INFERENCE 1      // Print detailed inference info
Performance Notes
Sample rate: 50Hz provides good balance between accuracy and performance
Window size: 2 seconds gives enough data for reliable classification
Memory usage: ~2.4KB for sensor buffer + model memory requirements
Inference time: Typically 20-50ms depending on model complexity
